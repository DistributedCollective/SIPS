# SIP-0063: Fix Staking Bug to Prevent Reverting Delegated Voting Power

## Description  

The Staking contract has been paused to prevent malicious use of the information disclosed by this SIP.

If approved, this proposal will upgrade the Staking module contract StakingStakeModule to an implementation that fixes the bug.

## Details

The bug allows any address to revert delegated voting power back to any delegator's address by staking any amount to the delegator's address.
