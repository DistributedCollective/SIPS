# SIP-0063: Fix Staking Bug to Prevent Reverting Delegated Voting Power

## Description  

The Staking contract has been paused to prevent malicious use of the information disclosed by this SIP.

If approved, this proposal will upgrade the StakingStakeModule contract to an implementation that fixes the bug.

## Details

A security researcher has reported a bug through Sovryn's Immunefi bug bounty program. The bug allows any address to revert any delegated voting power back to the delegator's address by staking any amount to the delegator's address. We have reproduced the bug and confirmed this is unintended behavior.

### Fix

Add conditional check to [fix the vulnerability](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts/commit/e3b14b40c9c51fd8273f159b6c791fa14b462f3e)

## Proposed change  

Existing StakingStakeModule contract: 0xdf41bD1F610d0DBe9D990e3eb04fd983777f1966  
New StakingStakeModule: 0xDf7224A755a8cf59c6D30ECC1a1efDd83C46EE36  
Proposed changes: [PR#500](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts/pull/500)
