# SIP-0064: Remove Legacy Code from Sovryn Mynt Contracts

## Description  

Sovryn Mynt was initially cloned from Babelfish protocol as the basis for Sovryn DLLR BTC-based stablecoin and then modified to meet DLLR product requirements.  
However in the process of development, it was decided not to use external bridges as sources for convertions.  
To stay on schedule it was decided to mute bridges functionality by the time of the first release which created a so-called 'technical debt' which we are paying back now.  

Legacy abandoned code not only causes confusion but also is a potential source of issues and vulnerabilities.  
Following contracts security best practices we have removed all the legacy code related to bridges.  
No functional contracts changes applied other than described above.

If approved, this proposal will upgrade contracts affected by the code cleanup: BasketManagerV3, MassetManager and FeesManager. 

## Proposed change

  BasketManagerV3: 0xb61Ff601E0b4531e39d9683c5Ab48873ccFd352B
