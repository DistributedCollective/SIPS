# SIP-0064: Remove Bridge Functions from Mynt

## Description  

Mynt was initially cloned from Babelfish protocol as the basis for Sovryn DLLR BTC-based stablecoin and then modified to meet Mynt product requirements.  However Babelfish uses bridges and in the process of development it was decided not to use it in Mynt.  
To stay on schedule bridges related functionality was muted by the time of the first release which created a so-called 'technical debt' we are paying back now.  

Unused code in smart contracts not only causes confusion but also is a potential source of issues and vulnerabilities in the future.  
Following smart contracts security best practices we have removed all the code related to bridges.  
There were not made any functional contracts changes other than the described above code cleanup.  

If approved, this proposal will upgrade Mynt contracts affected by the code cleanup: BasketManagerV3, MassetManager and FeesManager. 

## Proposed change  

Existing logic contracts 
  BasketManagerV3: 0xb61Ff601E0b4531e39d9683c5Ab48873ccFd352B  
  MassetManager: 0x90F16042abF49e3c08d7D37Aa5b8eDc439DF1D9d
