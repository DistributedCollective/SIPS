# SIP-0064: Remove Bridge Functions from Mynt

## Description  

There are two cases of the Mynt contracts upgrades included in this SIP:  
- Removal of legacy bridges related code 
- Technical upgrade of the contracts with the bytecode changed due to NatSpec comments modified   

  
### 1) Removal of legacy bridges related code

    Mynt was initially cloned from Babelfish protocol as the basis for Sovryn DLLR BTC-based stablecoin.     
    Babelfish uses bridges as trusted sources for convertions. Howerver it was decided not to use the bridges in Mynt.  
    To stay on schedule bridges related functionality was muted and unused by the time of the first release and which created a so-called 'technical debt' which we are paying back now.  

    Unused code in smart contracts not only causes confusion but also is a potential source of bugs and vulnerabilities in the future.  
    Following smart contracts security best practices we have removed all the code related to bridges.  


### 2) Technical upgrade

    Changes in OpenZeppelin (OZ) contract `Initializable` inherited by `FeesVault` and `MocIntegration` contracts: OZ package version upgrade to 4.8.3 among other fixes changed NatSpec functions comments which are added by a solidity compiler as metadata to the bytecode of the FeesVault and MocIntegration contracts:
