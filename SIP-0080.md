SIP-0080: Zero Protocol Redemption Page

## Proclamation text

Sovryn web application (reference deployment) should always include UI option for average users to redeem their ZUSD/DLLR via Zero Protocol.

## Motivation for writing this proclamation

The Zero Protocol redemption page UI was removed in an effort to reduce redemptions. However, redemptions still happen. Most of the redemptions were executed by the arbitragers who have direct access to the smart contract. To live by the standard of "you don't have to be technical to be free", all Sovryn users should have equal access to the redemption feature of the Zero Protocol.
