# SOV Rewards for staking

## The formula

The total staking duration, from the start date till the unlocking date, defines the height of the annual interest rate (APR). The formula to compute the APR is:

APR = duration * maxAPR/maxDuration

Where maxDuration is defined as 1092 on the staking contract and maxAPR is suggested to be set to 30%. 

Examples: users get 30% APR if staking for approx. 3 years and 10% APR if staking for approx. 1 year.

Note: There were concerns raised that users might stake longer to get a higher APR, without having the intention to actually leave the tokens staked for that long. It is possible to withdraw staked tokens early, but they are being slashed according to the quadratic formula which is also defining the voting power. A table can be viewed on the wiki. Because the losses through slashing would outweigh the gains through a higher interest rate, this should not be an issue.

## Technical implementation

The staking rewards are supposed to be distributed at the beginning of each new staking interval - that’s every second Friday. The distribution will happen in the form of liquid SOV by a script. The SOV are going to be added to the users’ claimable balances on the lockedSOV contract with an unlockedImmediatelyPercent of 100%. This means, the SOV will not be added to a vesting contract like usual, but transferred to the user directly on claiming.
