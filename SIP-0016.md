### SIP-0016: Proposal to upgrade Staking contract - apply fix to unlock Origin Vesting contracts

#### Background
Origin Vesting contracts have incorrect cliffs, so Vesting contracts pass incorrect dates to Staking contract.
Origin Vesting contract aren't upgradable, so it can be fixed on their side.
We need to update 2 functions in Staking contract: `getPriorUserStakeByDate` and `withdraw`.
Dates passed to these function will be adjusted (only for incorrect dates) to the end of 2 weeks period (it's March 26, 2021 10:28:15 AM for Origin Vestings).

#### Resolved
- The change implemented in [this pull request](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts/pull/180) at [this commit](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts/pull/180/commits/def4f0237c7e729332294374f9a8e2ab1b658955) will be implemented to unlock Origin Vesting contracts.
- The new Staking Logic contract is deployed at 0x962Ce6E2Fa1A4917DfF12Ad10135b1a4F16c2DB0.
