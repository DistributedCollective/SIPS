# SIP-0016: Proposal to upgrade Staking contract - apply fix to unlock Origin Vesting contracts

## Background
The Origin Vesting contracts have cliff is incorrect, leading to the Vesting contracts to pass incorrect dates to the Staking contract. 
This results in Origin token holders being unable to claim their SOV. Origin Vesting contracts aren't upgradable. 
Therefore, we need to update 2 functions in Staking contract: `getPriorUserStakeByDate` and `withdraw`. 
Dates passed to these functions will be adjusted (only for incorrect dates) to the end of the current 2 week period (March 26, 2021 10:28:15 AM for Origin Vestings).

## Resolved
- The change implemented in [this pull request](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts/pull/180) at [this commit](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts/pull/180/commits/def4f0237c7e729332294374f9a8e2ab1b658955) will be implemented to unlock Origin Vesting contracts.
- The new Staking Logic contract is deployed at 0x962Ce6E2Fa1A4917DfF12Ad10135b1a4F16c2DB0.
