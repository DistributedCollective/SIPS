Outline of SIP-0057 Proposal:

Listing $oDOGE on Sovryn AMM. (*Possibly be renamed $SoDOGE for the Rootstock chain.) Paired with RBTC for launch so that $SoDOGE would be “ON Bitcoin”

$oDOGE to seed the AMM with $125k $oDOGE and $125k RBTC (Bitcoin bridged to RSK through Sovryns FastBTC)
The combined Sovryn and oDOGE communities will provide additional liquidity as trading begins.
The $oDOGE community may withdraw the $oDOGE funds, but the minimum period before that will be possible is at least 12 months after the deposit (the oDOGE community has no motive for doing that, but it’s important to note either way).
$oDOGE reserves the right to add any additional tokens to incentivize liquidity providers in the pools
As a way of participating in this latest hype wave on Bitcoin, we have a unique opportunity to add $oDOGE Ordinal Doge to the Sovryn Protocol. The $oDOGE team will provide initial liquidity to the pools, so there is no need for Sovryn to seed the liquidity. This will increase liquidity on the Sovryn protocol, increase $USD stables bridged in which will help to bolster the new $DLLR launch and will increase overall volume and trading fees for all Sovryn stakers. It creates another way to earn APY, and arbitrage any price differences between Uniswap, CEX, and our Sovryn Protocol. Listing $oDOGE will be our ‘ticket’ to participate in massive Ordinal/BTC/ETH Twitter spaces, not as a spectator, but as a key speaker. Joint marketing will include Sovryn Logo in co-marketing.

By listing $oDOGE, new arbitrage opportunities will be opened for the Sovryn community as the $oDOGE token is paired with multiple tokens on Uniswap and LBank, and others.

$oDOGE/USDT on LBank,

$oDOGE/ETH on Uniswap,

$SoDOGE/RBTC on Sovryn (and can add additional pools like $SoDOGE/DLLR).

These new arbitrage opportunities will increase the volume on Sovryn and therefore will benefit the SOV holders, and liquidity pool providers, due to the fees taken from this new volume being added.

Motivation:

-Increase trading volume and TVL on the Sovryn dApp.

-Bring a new wave of users to the Sovryn community by using a “Meme-Coin” to bridge the gaps between ETH maxis and BTC maxis and show the power of EVM on bitcoin with RSK and the Sovryn Protocol.

Increase exposure and awareness for both the $oDOGE project and the Sovryn Protocol
Increase access to both $oDOGE and the Sovryn Protocol.
to show the world that we can and will compete with the $STX protocol, by embracing ordinals.
Potential Benefits for SOV stakers:

Increased BTC rewards from increased trading volume in the AMM.
SOV stakers do not have to do anything or be associated with the meme-coin to benefit.
No cost to Sovryn’s Adoption fund as the $oDOGE team will provide the liquidity for free.
Encourages more bitcoin DAOs and communities to come to build around the Sovryn ecosystem.
Increases incentive to LP in the Sovryn ecosystem if trading volume increases.
Adding a new token pair may bring more speculators to the SOV token.
Potential Benefits for Zero/DLLR protocol:

Increased stablecoin liquidity in the XUSD aggregator as potentially more ETH stablecoins enter the Sovryn ecosystem to trade $oDOGE on Sovryn’s AMM.
Allows for the Zero waiting list to open to more users and leads to more Zero LoCs. Hence, more ZUSD was minted, and more DLLR liquidity.
If the $oDOGE community allows for a $oDOGE/$DLLR pool then a potential way to increase the demand for DLLR is to reduce liquidity issues for Zero users. Overall, a better user experience for Zero users.
Implementation requirements:

Create/Add $oDOGE/RBTC pair and testing.
Dev team adding $oDOGE to UI/frontend and testing.
Adding $oDOGE to Sovryn-ETH bridge and testing.
Joint marketing spaces, PR, announcements, etc.
The oDOGE team cannot emphasize enough that decisive action and speed/urgency are of the essence to catch this Bitcoin Ordinal wave. It’s only fitting the first meme coin on Bitcoin should be traded on a BTC dex like Sovryn.

## Motivation for writing this proclamation

To list oDoge tokens we still need some work to do but declaring that the Sovryn community wants to add oDoge to the list of traded assets in the Sovryn DEX is just the first step in that direction. We will still need to create probably a final SIP which will include the parameters that will allow for the AMM pool to last at least 12 months. 

If locking funds on the current AMM format that Sovryn uses or the way all AMM pools work on Sovryn have a locking option by default without having to create extra work for Sovryn developers it will mean this SIP will only need for Exchequer to just adhere to the will of the community, if no additional work is need to guarantee funds will remain lock for at least 365 days after the first day the AMM pool is up and working.
