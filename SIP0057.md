# SIP-0057: Add Ordinal Doge Token ($oDOGE) to Sovryn AMM Pools

## Proclamation text

Add Ordinal Doge Token ($oDOGE) to Sovryn AMM Pools.

The Sovryn community management team has been in contact with the oDoge team and is proudly excited to share this proposal with the Sovryn community.

Background:

What Are Bitcoin Ordinals? https://ordinals.com/

Bitcoin Ordinals are “sats” or satoshis that have been ordered and inscribed with a piece of information, such as text or an image. This piece of information makes the sat unique and turns it into a de-facto NFT. Sats are the smallest unit of Bitcoin with a value of 0.00000001 BTC.

Here’s an easy-to-understand analogy: imagine two one-dollar bills. Both are completely fungible but have a serial code, which allows us to identify each dollar bill as unique. But if one bill was signed by Muhammed Ali and George Foreman, it becomes a “dollar NFT” of sorts. You could still spend it as a regular dollar, but the signatures make the bill’s value skyrocket.

Ordinals work in the same manner. They take advantage of the fact that each satoshi can be uniquely identified by its equivalent of a serial code. What Are Bitcoin Ordinals? The Ultimate Guide To Bitcoin NFTs | Alexandria

Ordinals are the new thing taking Bitcoin by storm. There are over 344,634 ordinal inscriptions as of the writing of this SIP. With Yuga Labs having raised over 700 BTC for their “Twelve Fold” Ordinals collection this past week, this new wave is here to stay.

What is $oDOGE?

The Ordinal Doge project launched on February 27th, 2023. A DOGE ordinal was inscribed, purchased for 10 BTC over the counter, and fractionalized to owners of the oDOGE meme coin. Allowing $oDOGE to live forever inscribed on bitcoin. Meaning, $oDOGE is the first-ever Dogecoin on bitcoin. $oDOGE combines Bitcoin, Ordinals, and Smart Contracts to create the first-ever Bitcoin-native meme coin. By combining Ordinals and smart contracts on Ethereum, we have been able to successfully create a meme-coin fully hosted on the Bitcoin Blockchain! The original $oDOGE ordinal can be viewed here 1, where it lives forever on the Bitcoin Blockchain. Thanks to Emblem Vaults, we have been able to wrap and fractionalize this ordinal from Bitcoin to Ethereum, transforming it from an Ordinal to an ERC-721 to an ERC-20 token, which can now interact with dApps/DEXes deployed on ETH Mainnet. The official Ordinal Doge website can be found here: https://odoge.co/.

Ordinal Doge $oDOGE — The ORIGINAL DOGE on Bitcoin! | by Mr oDOGE | Feb, 2023 | Medium 1 Currently, 10.8k Followers on Twitter and growing! [https://twitter.com/OrdinalDogecoin ]https://twitter.com/dogecoinordinal?s=21&t=IwQYMz-hFMUHftJ9tnu1pg)

The Ordinal Doge community has accomplished many milestones in such a short time. They are now listed on Uniswap and emerging centralized exchanges BKEXGlobal and LBank. The $oDOGE community also has close ties to the Shiba Inu community (Market cap of $6 Billion) and $100s of Million in trading volume still daily on various exchanges. They have many partnerships lined up including “Brothers Marketing”.

Both Sovryn and Ordinal Doge would also make Bitcoin history again with $oDOGE being the first ever ETH native token to migrate to a Bitcoin sidechain. This is a great publicity opportunity for both communities and will inform the crypto space at large about Sovryn and the growing presence of DeFi on Bitcoin. The $oDOGE token was created on ETH but belonged on Bitcoin and this proposal makes that possible.

This way, Bitcoiners can buy the first Bitcoin meme-coin on Bitcoin itself with Bitcoin, and every bridge, swap, or trade will bring fees to Sovryn Stakers.

Outline of SIP-0057 Proposal:

Listing $oDOGE on Sovryn AMM. (*Possibly be renamed $SoDOGE for the Rootstock chain.) Paired with RBTC for launch so that $SoDOGE would be “ON Bitcoin”
$oDOGE to seed the AMM with $125k $oDOGE and $125k RBTC (Bitcoin bridged to RSK through Sovryns FastBTC)
The combined Sovryn and oDOGE communities will provide additional liquidity as trading begins.
The $oDOGE community may withdraw the $oDOGE funds, but the minimum period before that will be possible is at least 12 months after the deposit (the oDOGE community has no motive for doing that, but it’s important to note either way).
$oDOGE reserves the right to add any additional tokens to incentivize liquidity providers in the pools
As a way of participating in this latest hype wave on Bitcoin, we have a unique opportunity to add $oDOGE Ordinal Doge to the Sovryn Protocol. The $oDOGE team will provide initial liquidity to the pools, so there is no need for Sovryn to seed the liquidity. This will increase liquidity on the Sovryn protocol, increase $USD stables bridged in which will help to bolster the new $DLLR launch and will increase overall volume and trading fees for all Sovryn stakers. It creates another way to earn APY, and arbitrage any price differences between Uniswap, CEX, and our Sovryn Protocol. Listing $oDOGE will be our ‘ticket’ to participate in massive Ordinal/BTC/ETH Twitter spaces, not as a spectator, but as a key speaker. Joint marketing will include Sovryn Logo in co-marketing.

By listing $oDOGE, new arbitrage opportunities will be opened for the Sovryn community as the $oDOGE token is paired with multiple tokens on Uniswap and LBank, and others.

$oDOGE/USDT on LBank,

$oDOGE/ETH on Uniswap,

$SoDOGE/RBTC on Sovryn (and can add additional pools like $SoDOGE/DLLR).

These new arbitrage opportunities will increase the volume on Sovryn and therefore will benefit the SOV holders, and liquidity pool providers, due to the fees taken from this new volume being added.

Motivation:

-Increase trading volume and TVL on the Sovryn dApp.

-Bring a new wave of users to the Sovryn community by using a “Meme-Coin” to bridge the gaps between ETH maxis and BTC maxis and show the power of EVM on bitcoin with RSK and the Sovryn Protocol.

Increase exposure and awareness for both the $oDOGE project and the Sovryn Protocol
Increase access to both $oDOGE and the Sovryn Protocol.
to show the world that we can and will compete with the $STX protocol, by embracing ordinals.
Potential Benefits for SOV stakers:

Increased BTC rewards from increased trading volume in the AMM.
SOV stakers do not have to do anything or be associated with the meme-coin to benefit.
No cost to Sovryn’s Adoption fund as the $oDOGE team will provide the liquidity for free.
Encourages more bitcoin DAOs and communities to come to build around the Sovryn ecosystem.
Increases incentive to LP in the Sovryn ecosystem if trading volume increases.
Adding a new token pair may bring more speculators to the SOV token.
Potential Benefits for Zero/DLLR protocol:

Increased stablecoin liquidity in the XUSD aggregator as potentially more ETH stablecoins enter the Sovryn ecosystem to trade $oDOGE on Sovryn’s AMM.
Allows for the Zero waiting list to open to more users and leads to more Zero LoCs. Hence, more ZUSD was minted, and more DLLR liquidity.
If the $oDOGE community allows for a $oDOGE/$DLLR pool then a potential way to increase the demand for DLLR is to reduce liquidity issues for Zero users. Overall, a better user experience for Zero users.
Implementation requirements:

Create/Add $oDOGE/RBTC pair and testing.
Dev team adding $oDOGE to UI/frontend and testing.
Adding $oDOGE to Sovryn-ETH bridge and testing.
Joint marketing spaces, PR, announcements, etc.
The oDOGE team cannot emphasize enough that decisive action and speed/urgency are of the essence to catch this Bitcoin Ordinal wave. It’s only fitting the first meme coin on Bitcoin should be traded on a BTC dex like Sovryn.

## Motivation for writing this proclamation

To list oDoge tokens we still need some work to do but declaring that the Sovryn community wants to add oDoge to the list of traded assets in the Sovryn DEX is just the first step in that direction. We will still need to create probably a final SIP which will include the parameters that will allow for the AMM pool to last at least 365 days if not more. 

If locking funds on the current AMM format that Sovryn uses or the way all AMM pools work on Sovryn have a locking option by default without having to create extra work for Sovryn developers it will mean this SIP will only need for Exchequer to just adhere to the will of the community, if no additional work is need to guarantee funds will remain lock for at least 365 days after the first day the AMM pool is up and working.
