# SIP-0042: Staking contract updates

## Description  

If approved, this proposal will:

1. Replace the current staking contract with a new staking contract, with the only changes being targeted fixes for the issues described below.
2. Add the Exchequer Multisig as a pauser to the Staking contract, with the authority to set the contract on pause or freeze in case of emergency.

## Motivation  

**Improve security of the Staking contract**  

It is necessary to act fast and pause or freeze the Staking contract in case of a vulnerability/bug is found. 

1. Pause/Unpause - when paused the contract becomes not functional except for unstaking till unpaused. Pause is set if there is no threat identified for unstaking. 
2. Freeze/Unfreeze - if unstaking is vulnerable, freezing the contract will also prevent users from unstaking till the vulnerability fixed. 

To be able to invoke pausing and freezing functionality Exchequer needs to be set as a pauser in the Staking contract.

- Existing Staking Logic contract: `0x4BaBb34189a9CDa8213D24DD3984058Fb8A955D2`
