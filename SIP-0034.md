# SIP-0034: Completion of SIP-0015 and Additional Release of SOV


This SIP proposes the transfer of SOV from the Adoption Fund, Development Fund and GoverorVaultOwner to the Exchequer multisig.

## History of SOV transfers:

- SIP-0015: Sovryn Treasury Management (link provided [here](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/SIPS/blob/main/SIP-0015.md)) approved an operating budget of 5,639,130.56 SOV to be made available to the Exchequer Multisig.

- SIP-0029: Transfer of SOV Pursuant to SIP-0015 (link provided [here](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/SIPS/blob/main/SIP-0029.md)) facilitated the transfer of 1,050,000 SOV from the GovernorVaultAdmin contract, to the Exchequer Multisig.

## This SIP proposes to facilitate the following:

1. The transfer of the additional 4,589,130.56 SOV previously approved in SIP-0015, to the Exchequer multisig.
2. The transfer of SOV that is currently liquid for the Adoption Fund, Development Fund and GovernorVaultOwner to the Exchequer, which constitute a total of 13,085,263.33 SOV, which includes an amount of 4,589,130.56 SOV (previously approved by SIP-0015 but not transferred pursuant to SIP-0029).

This proposed transfer is needed in order to facilitate upcoming SOV expenses required for the purposes of development and adoption of the Sovryn protocol.

## SOV Expenses to date:

To date the Exchequer has deployed a total of 3,309,836.54 SOV for the purposes of further development of the Sovryn protocol. The breakdown of these expenses is available [here](https://docsend.com/view/6nh9nb6p2cinzv9w).

## Resolved:

To transfer the following SOV to the Exchequer multisig:
