# SIP-0029: Transfer of SOV Pursuant to SIP-0015

## Description

SIP-0015: Sovryn Treasury Management (link provided [here](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/SIPS/blob/main/SIP-0015.md)) approved an operating budget of 5,639,130.56 SOV to be made available to the Exchequer Multisig. 
This budget is intended to be drawn from three funds: the Ecosystem Fund, Adoption Fund and Development Fund. 
SIP-0015 resolved that the transfer of SOV requires additional and separate SIPs. This SIP will facilitate the transfer of a total of 1,050,000 SOV 
from the GovernorVaultAdmin contract, to the Exchequer Multisig. The SOV to be transferred is drawn from the Ecosystem Fund and Adoption Fund, as outlined below:

| **Contract Name** | **Contract Address** | **Vesting** | **Total Amount (SOV)** |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Adoption Fund | | | |
| GovernorVaultAdmin | 0x51C754330c6cD04B810014E769Dab0343E31409E | No vesting | 800,000 |
| Ecosystem Fund | | | |
| GovernorVaultAdmin | 0x51C754330c6cD04B810014E769Dab0343E31409E | No vesting | 250,000 |
