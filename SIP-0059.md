# SIP-0059: Zero Fee Floor Update: March 22

## Background:
On March 21â€™st, 2023, the community held the first DLLR Zero Risk Meeting. The recording and subsequent conversation can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTM8yAlFAI). 
Our priorities, in order of importance, are:
  1. Maintain the DLLR peg
  2. Keep redemption level low   

In the near term we expect to see multiple DLLR demand drivers emerge. In the interim we are willing to accept significantly reduced borrowing demand. Conversely, to promote DLLR hoDLLRs, we seek to keep the lower bound of DLLR close to $1.00.

The expectation is that the 5% base fee will be temporary and that fees will be reduced to the minimal advisable level over time.

## Resolved:
  1. Increase the Origination fee - Base: 5%; Max 7.5%
  2. Reduce the redemption fee - Base: 1.9%

## Code changes:

Updating BORROWING_FEE_FLOOR from 2.5% to 5%  
Updating MAX_BORROWING_FEE to 7.5%  
Updating REDEMPTION_FEE_FLOOR from 2.5% to 1.9%
