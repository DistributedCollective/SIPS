# SIP-0049 : Staking contract refactoring due to EIP-170 size limits

## Description  

The Staking contract has reached the EIP-170 solidity contracts size limits.  

It has been redesigned to a modular structure lifting any size limits now and forever. 

The SIP also includes the following improvements:

- `stakeBySchedule` function on the staking contract which is used by the vesting contracts to stake 
the vested tokens uniformly over a certain number of intervals, was making a token transfer for each interval 
which is not a gas-efficient way. It is redesigned to have only one token transfer per operation.

- Governance Vesting withdraw function was unable to withdraw team vested tokens in some cases where there are too many stakes to iterate 
running into a  block gas limit. 
It was refactored and the flow also improved to exclude redundant function calls between Staking and Vesting contracts.

If approved, this SIP will replace the Staking Logic contract in the Staking Proxy contract for the new StakingModulesProxy contract 
which orchestrates calls to the Staking logic functions grouped into meaningfull module contracts. Therefore refactoring does not change any 
staking contract logic except for the listed above improvements.


## Motivation

Staking contract logic hit the EIP-170 limits which does not allow to add any functionality to it. 

There were two long awaited to be resolved issues with stakeByShcedule function and Governance Vesting Withdraw function. 


## Details

In order to resolve the issues, a new modular contracts system based on existing verified and audited solution was designed and implemented. 
- a new reusable ModulesProxy contract is for handling all the Staking logic function calls to the respective modules contracts. 
- 7 new modules contracts is a split of a large Staking contract functionality:
