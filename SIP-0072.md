# SIP-0072: Remove Bridge Functions from Mynt

## Description  

There are two Mynt contract updates included in this SIP:  
- Removal of legacy code related to the Sovryn Bridge integration  
- Technical update of the contracts with the bytecode changed due to modified NatSpec comments  

  
### 1) Removal of legacy bridges related code

Mynt was initially cloned from Babelfish protocol as the basis for Sovryn DLLR BTC-based stablecoin.     

Babelfish uses bridges as trusted sources for conversions. However it was decided not to use the bridges in Mynt.  

To keep Mynt development on schedule, the bridge-related functionality was muted and unused, which created technical debt that we are paying back now with this SIP.  

Unused code in smart contracts not only causes confusion for reviewers and integrators but is also a potential source of bugs and vulnerabilities in the future.  

Following smart contract security best practices we have removed all the code related to bridge integration.  

### 2) Technical upgrade

Changes in OpenZeppelin (OZ) contract `Initializable` inherited by `FeesVault` and `MocIntegration` contracts: OZ package version upgrade to 4.8.3 among other fixes changed the NatSpec function comments, which are added by a solidity compiler as metadata to the bytecode of the FeesVault and MocIntegration contracts:
