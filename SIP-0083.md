# **SIP-0083: Sovryn - BitcoinOS Contributor and $BOS Token Launch**   

## 1. Overview 

BitcoinOS (BOS) is being developed to allow any code to be executed on Bitcoin, representing a fundamental upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol. 
As one of the key development teams, Sovryn proposes to launch this technology.  

Throughout BitcoinOS’s development, Sovryn has made substantial contributions through project incubation, design partnership, research, 
development, testing, communications, and community engagement. We commit to continuing this involvement while developing 
a new Bitcoin-native token standard for the BOS ecosystem.

In order for BitcoinOS, developed as Open Source Software (OSS), to succeed, the project needs broad distribution and 
a decentralized network of users and developers. Sovryn proposes to provide the decentralized governance framework and 
committed community needed for this launch. As part of this service, Sovryn will contribute to the issuance and 
distribution of the $BOS tokens and develop core parts of the BitcoinOS technical infrastructure.  
To facilitate this, 10% of the total supply of $BOS tokens will be earmarked for the Sovryn community.  

## 2. Background

BitcoinOS has achieved significant technological milestones, beginning with the verification of the first ZK proof on Bitcoin mainnet in July 2024, 
followed by the release of the first open-source code for Bitcoin ZK proof verification in September 2024. 
Their progress in developing ZK-based infrastructure has established new standards for Bitcoin L2s, towards L1 security, trustless bridging, 
scalability, and native transaction privacy.

Teams working on the project are currently focused on developing Grail, the first trustless Bitcoin L2 bridge, and MerkleMesh, 
which will bring full interoperability to users and liquidity in the BitcoinOS ecosystem. Significant ecosystems have announced 
their plan to integrate with and contribute to BitcoinOS infrastructure, including Cardano and leading Bitcoin sidechains such as 
Merlin Chain, Nubit, and B² Network. Further significant integrations with additional collaborators are developing.

Given Sovryn’s role in incubating BitcoinOS, our appreciation of its technological potential and traction, and the interest already expressed 
in a forum posted titled “SIP-XXXX: Launch of BitcoinOS (BOS) Under Sovryn Incubation” posted on June 18, 2024, we propose to leverage our 
expertise in decentralized governance to perform the decentralized launch of BOS and its $BOS token and to lead the development of a much 
needed Bitcoin native and programmable token standard.   

## 3. Sovryn Bitocracy and Strategic Alignment with BitcoinOS

Sovryn has achieved genuine decentralization and effective decentralized governance, maintaining high levels of diverse stakeholder participation. 
Our Bitocracy model and committed community provide a robust framework for launching decentralized projects.

We believe that Sovryn, by leveraging its established decentralized framework, can ensure BitcoinOS’ decentralized launch and decentralization from 
inception, setting a new standard in the Bitcoin-native ecosystem. Our proposal includes:

- Sovryn has been a key design partner for BitcoinOS, offering valuable expertise in project incubation, research, and strategic guidance. 
The teams working within Sovryn will continue with these efforts.
- Launching the BOS protocol and distributing the $BOS token through Sovryn Bitocracy and Sovryn’s core team.   
- Collaborative development between Sovryn and the teams working on BitcoinOS technology to determine a framework for equitable total token distribution.  
- Allow teams to leverage Sovryn Bitocracy to propose and initiate the development of technologies related and required for the BitcoinOS ecosystem.  
- Sovryn will consider itself one of the founding groups of the BitcoinOS ecosystem.  
- Sovryn and other BOS teams will collaborate in launching the Sovryn Layer as it will defined by Bitocracy.  
- Sovryn will retain 10% of the total $BOS token supply.  

## 4. BOS Launch
### 4.1 Project Development and Launch

  BOS Development: We will support BOS developers in their focus on building and refining the technology under an OSS (Open Source Software) framework.
  Network Launch: Sovryn Sorcery will assist in launching the BOS network, ensuring its integration with the broader Bitcoin ecosystem.
  Token Launch: Sovryn will issue the $BOS tokens and facilitate the initial distribution, including the portion designated for the Sovryn community.

### 4.2 Resource Mobilization and Governance

Sovryn will invest in the development of the BitcoinOS open-source ecosystem. The following resources will be allocated to support the following activities:

  - Education
      - Development and distribution of technical documentation
      - Creation of educational content for developers and users
      - Organization of workshops and training sessions
  - Marketing and Communications
      - Strategic marketing campaigns to drive adoption
      - Community outreach and engagement
      - Regular updates and announcements
      - Market research and analysis
  - Technical Development
      - Development of a Bitcoin-native token standard
      - Security audits of protocol components
      - Comprehensive user testing programs
      - Development and maintenance of essential front-end interfaces
      - Integration support for partners and developers
  - Network Operations
      - Nomination and support of qualified node operators
      - Network monitoring and maintenance
      - Performance optimization
      - Infrastructure support
  - Strategic Initiatives
      - Identification and development of strategic partnerships
      - Ecosystem growth initiatives
      - Protocol integration with complementary projects
      - Support for developer community building

  - Additional activities required for the success of BitcoinOS as a decentralized protocol will be undertaken as needed, 
subject to community governance through Bitocracy.

### 4.3 Token Distribution and Stakeholder Incentives

  - Sovryn will issue the $BOS tokens and distribute them to the different stakeholders.
  - We will collaboratively develop a framework for equitable token distribution of the 10% allocation retained by Sovryn. This token distribution will be submitted for approval of the Bitocracy in a future SIP.
  - Additional SIPs may be proposed to determine various aspects of Sovryn’s responsibilities and commitments to BitcoinOS.

## 5. BitcoinOS Independence

To maintain credible neutrality, BOS development will remain independent of Sovryn. Sovryn Bitocracy will have no decision-making power 
over any element of BOS not specifically listed in this SIP.
