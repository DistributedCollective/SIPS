# SIP-0065: Permission update on the Adoption and Development Funds

## Description:
The Adoption and DevelopmentFunds have a predetermined vesting schedule. The SOV that vests are to be distributed to the management of the Exchequer Committee. To manage the Adoption Fund SOV, there are two roles on the smart contract: the owner of the contract as well as all funds which are still vesting, and the owner of the tokens which already became liquid according to the vesting schedule. Currently, both roles are fulfilled by the timelock contract of the owner governor. Consequently, these funds can only be withdrawn with a SIP. For the SOV that is released by the Development Fund vesting schedule, a contract revision is not required, however approval for the transfer of released SOV from the Development Fund to the Exchequer, shall also be included in this SIP.

SIP-0015 outlined the Exchequer Committeeâ€™s role in managing the SOV tokens released from the Adoption and Development Funds.  This SIP-0065 will allow the Exchequer to continue operating under this mandate without the operational overhead of requiring a new SIP for every transfer of SOV from the Adoption and Development Funds to the Exchequer. 

## Proposed changes:
On the adoption fund contract (0x0f31cfd6aAb4d378668Ad74DeFa89d3f4DB26633) set unlockedTokenOwner to the Exchequer multisig address (0x924f5ad34698Fd20c90Fe5D5A8A0abd3b42dc711).
