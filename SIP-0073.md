# SIP-0073: Refactor Sovryn Protocol Interface with AMM

## Issue  

The contract SwapsImplSovrynSwap serves as an interface between the Sovryn protocol functionality and Sovryn AMM to swap assets and query exchange rates.  
The way it is implemented is confusing and error prone because in some cases it is used as a standalone contract with its own storage and sometimes as a library 
executing delegated calls from the protocol modules and using its storage.  
Because AMM swaps and exchange rates queries are used by every protocl module - it is is a crutial part or our codebase whcih required refactoring to improve 
robustness and clarity of our codebase for both internal usage and external itegrations implicitly improving security. 

## Solution

We refactored the SwapsImplSovrynSwap by converting it into a Sovryn protocol module SwapsImplSovrynSwapModule and extracting all the AMM integration functions 
into a library which increases the AMM interface robustnessness and clarity. 

__If approved, this proposal will update all the Sovryn protocol modules and add a new SwapsImplSovrynSwapModule.__
