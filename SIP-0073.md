# SIP-0073: Refactor Sovryn Protocol Interface with AMM

## Issue  

The contract SwapsImplSovrynSwap serves as an interface between Sovryn protocol functionality and the Sovryn AMM to swap assets and query exchange rates.  
The way it is implemented is confusing and error prone because in some cases it is used as a standalone contract with its own storage and sometimes as a library executing delegated calls from the protocol modules and using its storage.  
Because AMM swaps and exchange rates queries are used by every protocol module - it is is a crucial part of our codebase which requires refactoring to improve robustness and clarity of our codebase, for both internal usage and external integrations implicitly improving security. 

## Solution

We refactored the SwapsImplSovrynSwap by converting it into a Sovryn protocol module SwapsImplSovrynSwapModule and extracting all the AMM integration functions into a library which increases the robustnessness and clarity of the AMM interface. 

__If approved, this proposal will update all the Sovryn protocol modules and add a new SwapsImplSovrynSwapModule.__
