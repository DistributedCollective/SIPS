# SIP-0006-A1: Origin Pre-Sale

Amendment 1

## TLDR

Origin sale was oversubscribed. Sovryn paused deposits to the Origin sale in order to avoid receiving too many funds, which would necessitate many manually processed redemptions. In total, over 200 BTC was received. However, after accounting for donations and redemptions the total amount of BTC eligible for SOV distribution is 194.7. As a result, 5.29 BTC of the potential allocation remains unclaimed.

The team has reached a consensus that it is not worth reopening deposits to collect these 5.29 BTC, as that dev effort can be better spent on further development of the system and onboarding new users to the platform who participated in the Origin sale.

Therefore it is proposed to distribute the allocated 2M SOV to the current set of depositors, this would set the effective price at 9736 sats per SOV.

## Proposal

**Resolved:**

1. Distribute 2,000,000 SOV to participants that deposited BTC in the Origin pre-deposit, at a clearing price of 9736 sats per SOV.
2. No further changes to SIP-0006
