### SIP-0010: Proposal to upgrade Staking contract - apply fix to cover an edge case

#### Background
The current Staking contractâ€™s `stakeByschedule` function, used by the current Vesting contracts, only allows staking for a minimum of two intervals with 4 weeks in-between. Therefore, the current Staking contract cannot be used with a Origin Presale Vesting contract.

#### Resolved
- The change implemented in [this pull request](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts/pull/159) at [this commit](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts/pull/159/commits/c44a43969fba41285afbc23adbce7edc83d9104a) will be implemented to a) allow staking for a minimum of one interval, and b) allow us to use a Origin Presale Vesting contract with the Staking contract.
- The new Staking Logic contract is deployed at 0x5b87F01F665050d244543ca047317C26862E47f7.
