# SIP-0060: Add DLLR as collateral for borrowing

## Description

If approved, this proposal would enable DLLR holders to use their DLLR as collateral when borrowing using Sovryn.

## Motivation

Adding DLLR as a collateral asset for borrowing would give DLLR holders a way to short any supported asset using DLLR as collateral instead of either a less liquid stablecoin such as DOC or a less transparent stablecoin such as XUSD.

A 150% collateralization ratio is proposed due to DLLRâ€™s position as the most liquid pool on the Sovryn AMM. This is at par with the 150% collateralization required when using DOC or XUSD as collateral.

## Proposed change

Add DLLR as system-wide collateral for borrowing any asset supported on Sovryn, with the following parameters:
- DLLR token contract address: `0xc1411567D2670E24D9c4Daaa7CdA95686E1250Aa`  
- Collateralization rate: 150%  
- Oracle: Constant value oracle
