### SIP 0003 - Activation of Genesis Reservation ###

Resolved:

1. The Sovryn protocol will issue up to 2,000,000 cSOV tokens. This represent a 200,000 increase from 1,800,000 of SIP 0002.
2. cSOV tokens will provide a pre-reservation mechanism for community members to stake funds in order to receive the right to SOV tokens, on a 1:1 basis with cSOV tokens subject to a vote by SOV holders.
3. These cSOV tokens will be distributed to stakers who have the early community NFTS.
4. The required stake per cSOV token will be 2500 Satoshis
5. Any cSOV tokens converted to SOV will be subject to 10 months linear vesting (with 1/10 of the total amount released on a monthly basis) from the date of the end of the SOV public sale.
6. Any cSOV holder that does not actively convert their cSOV to SOV within a two month period after TGE will be able to receive their staked funds.
