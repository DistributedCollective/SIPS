# SIP-C: Splitting AMM fees with stakers

## Description

- Currently only AMM Liquidity Providers earn a fee from swaps conducted using the Sovryn AMM.  
- This change will split the fee between AMM Liquidity Providers and the Fee Proxy contract (the smart contract responsible for holding fees until stakers withdraw them).  
- The split will be 0.25% to LPs / 0.05% to Fee Proxy.  

## Motivation

Although the Sovryn AMM is a core piece of the Sovryn protocol, which SOV stakers must take care to govern well, SOV stakers earn no share of the fees generated by the AMM and are therefore out of alignment with the incentives of AMM LPs. This SIP aims to better align the incentives between SOV stakers and AMM LPs by splitting AMM fees between SOV stakers and AMM LPs.

The change proposed here works with the existing swap module of the Sovryn Trading and Lending protocol, and is therefore the easiest way to implement this change. However the fee split can be circumvented if the AMM is interacted with outside of the Sovryn frontend interface. It is planned that a SIP will be introduced in the near future to update the AMM smart contract to support splitting the fee in a way that cannot be circumvented.
