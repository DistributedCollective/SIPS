#SIP-0051: Adjustment of the AMM fee-split 

## Description

Currently, AMM swaps have a fee of 0.3%: 0.25% for AMM liquidity providers, 0.05% for the protocol (stakers).
This SIP proposes to adjust the fee-split towards: 0.25% for AMM liquidity providers (unchanged), 0.1% for the protocol(stakers).
This would result in a fee increase from 0.3% to 0.35%. AMM liquidity providers are unaffected, protocol revenue from AMM swaps would double.

## Motivation

The related analysis, discussion and arguments can be found here: https://forum.sovryn.app/t/circle-of-tokens-regarding-protocol-revenue/2701

In Summary:

When we look at protocol incentives (SOV-rewards) versus protocol revenue, there's a significant deficit. 
With the proposed parameter change, we aim to reduce this deficit.

The objectives of this parameter change are:
-Increased fundamental value of SOV token through increased protocol revenue. Making the staking of SOV more attractive.
-Increased $ value of weekly SOV rewards for liquidity provider.
-Increased liquidity in AMM pools OR same liquidity with a lowered amount of SOV-rewards, effectively reducing liquid SOV supply. 


## Proposed change

Existing parameter(s): AMM swap fee for stakers : 0.05%  
Proposed change: AMM swap fee for stakers : 0.1%
